# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
Data science Project with python, plotly, sweetviz, dask, scikit-learn, LGBM


## Introduction: 

The Microsoft Malware Prediction competition was a machine learning competition hosted on the Kaggle platform. The goal of the competition was to predict whether a Windows machine has malware or not based on various features related to the machine's behavior and configuration.

The competition was sponsored by Microsoft and the dataset used in the competition was a large-scale dataset containing a variety of features related to over millions Windows machines. The dataset was designed to simulate a real-world scenario where machine learning models would be used to detect and prevent malware infections on large-scale networks.

The competition was open to data scientists and machine learning practitioners from around the world, who were tasked with building and training models that could accurately predict the presence of malware on a given Windows machine. Participants were provided with training data and a testing dataset, and were scored based on the accuracy of their predictions on the testing dataset.

The competition was an opportunity for data scientists to showcase their skills and techniques in the field of machine learning, while also contributing to the development of tools and technologies that can help prevent malware infections and improve the security of computer networks.

The competition has now ended, but the dataset and competition materials are still available on Kaggle for anyone interested in exploring and analyzing the data or building their own models.


## Project Tasks:



1. To optimize the data storage and processing, I converted a 4.5 GB CSV file into an 820 MB Parquet file.

2. To speed up the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I generated a quick data report using Sweetviz.

3. For better data visualization and user-friendliness, I used Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing charts.

4. Finally, I utilized the Light Gradient Boosting model for high accuracy.
